# :seedling:  # 0x00. Python - Hello, World :seedling:
Holberton School's first projects where you learn about the PYTHON programming language.

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
### Python Scripts :pencil2:
-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using  `python3`  (version 3.4.3)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A  `README.md`  file at the root of the  `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming`  repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of  _this_  project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the  `PEP 8`  style (version  `1.7.*`)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using  `wc`

### Shell Scripts :pencil2:

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file`  should print 2)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly  `#!/bin/bash`
-   All your files must be executable

### C Scripts :pencil2:

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   Your programs and functions will be compiled with  `gcc 4.8.4`  using the flags  `-Wall`  `-Werror`  `-Wextra`  `and -pedantic`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   Your code should use the  `Betty`  style. It will be checked using  [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl")  and  [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   You are not allowed to use global variables
-   No more than 5 functions per file
-   In the following examples, the  `main.c`  files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you dont have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own  `main.c`  files at compilation. Our  `main.c`  files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called  `lists.h`
-   Dont forget to push your header file
-   All your header files should be include guarded
