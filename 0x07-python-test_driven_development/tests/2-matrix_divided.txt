==============================
The "2-matrix_divided" module
==============================

Using "matrix_divided"
-----------------------

This is the test file for the function that is responsible for dividing
the values ​​of a matrix by a number defined by the main function.

Import function:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

Basic matrix division:

    >>> matrix = [[4, 9, 5], [10, 12, 97]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[2.0, 4.5, 2.5], [5.0, 6.0, 48.5]]

Float item division:

    >>> matrix = [[5.9, 7.5, 10.3], [7.23, 5.13, 3.15]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[1.97, 2.5, 3.43], [2.41, 1.71, 1.05]]

Divide by 0:

    >>> matrix = [[12.3, 5, 5.9], [3, 5, 8.6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Row of different size: 

    >>> matrix = [[5, 4, 2], [6, 9, 3, 7]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::

    >>> matrix = [[5, 4, 2, 6], [7, 3, 7.4]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::
    >>> matrix = [[], [2, 5, 8]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Wrong parameters:

    >>> matrix = [["j", "k", "z"], [4, 5, 12]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 6)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

    >>> matrix = [[2, 4, 6], [7, 12, 5]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, "hello")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number
